## Welcome to the Demo Site for Text Embedding Visualization

With the help of the variouis [text embedding models](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=text-embedding) from TensorFlow Hub, it is easy to create embeddings for such text units as words, sentences, paragraphs, or even documents in a corpus. This site presents some text embedding results from differnt corpora for visualization through the [TensorFlow Embedding Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/).

You are welcome to fork the repository for personal demo purposes.
